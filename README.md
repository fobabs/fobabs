# Hey there, I'm FOBABS 👋

Welcome to my little corner of the internet! I'm a **Software Engineer** who lives in the exciting intersection of **blockchain**, **security**, and **creative problem solving**.

I spend my days building things for the decentralized world, from smart contracts to security tools and occasionally, entire ecosystems.

### 🧠 What I'm up to

- 🔐 Researching Web3 vulnerabilities and pushing smart contract security forward
- 🛠️ Building cool tools beyond reasonable doubts
- 🌍 Exploring Real World Assets, DePIN, DeFi, and everything decentralizable
- 🧪 Running experiments in my lab

### 🛠️ Tech & Tools

```solidity
Solidity • Rust • Python • TypeScript • Bash
```

And yes, I’m a big fan of clean CLI tools and meaningful open-source.
