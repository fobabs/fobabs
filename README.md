# Hi! 👋 Earthlings

I am best known as a **Technology Developer** 👨🏿‍💻 with specialty in *Software Development* and *Data Analysis*.

I have been hiding all along somewhere far away in the galaxy but I'm back to earth 😄. On my return, I landed in Nigeria.

Since then, I have been committed to using technology to advance human abilities and inspiring them with things that enable them to get better.

All in all, nothing gives me the utmost joy than my service to humanity.

There is a slogan I carved out for myself:
> If it isn't *techie*, it isn't **FOBABS**.

## Some interesting things I do:

* I'm building a brand around my name **FOBABS**
  
* I talk a lot on twitter [@fobabs](https://twitter.com/fobabs)

* I write ✍️ on my [Blog](https://blog.fobabs.com)

* I play the piano 🎹 on weekends.
