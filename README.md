# Hi! 👋 Earthlings

I am best known as a **Technology Developer** 👨🏿‍💻 and **Content Creator**.

I have been hiding all along somewhere far away in the galaxy but I'm back to earth 😄. On my return, I landed in Nigeria.

Since then, I have been committed to using technology to advance human abilities and inspiring them with things that enable them to get better.

All in all, nothing gives me the utmost joy than my service to humanity.

There is a slogan I carved out for myself:
> If it isn't *techie*, it isn't **FOBABS**.

## Some interesting things I do:

* I'm building a brand around **FOBABS**
  
* I talk a lot on twitter [@fobabs](https://twitter.com/fobabs)

* I write ✍️ on [Medium](https://medium.com/@fobabs)

* I play the piano 🎹 on weekends.
