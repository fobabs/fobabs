# Hi! 👋 Earthlings

I am best known as a **Techie** 👨🏿‍💻 with specialty in *Data* and *Technology*.

I have been hiding all along somewhere far away in the galaxy but I'm back to earth 😄. On my return, I landed in Nigeria.

Since my arrival, my mission has been to build people to use technology to grow and my goal is to harness the power of data and technology to make them maximize their potentials.

All in all, nothing gives me the utmost joy than my service to humanity.


## Some interesting things I do:

* I'm building a brand around my name **FOBABS**
  
* I talk a lot on twitter [@fobabs](https://twitter.com/fobabs)

* I write ✍️ on my [Blog](https://blog.fobabs.com)

* I play the piano 🎹 on weekends.
