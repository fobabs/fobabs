# Hi! 👋 Earthlings

I am best known as a **Techie** 👨🏿‍💻 who eats Software for *breakfast*, *lunch* and *dinner*.

I have been hiding all along somewhere far away in the galaxy but I'm back to earth 😄. On my return, I landed in Nigeria.

Since my arrival, my mission has been to build people by harnessing the power of data and technology to improve their lives and make them maximize their potentials.

All in all, nothing gives me the utmost joy than my service to humanity.


## Some interesting things I do:

* I'm building a brand around my name **FOBABS**
  
* I tend to be nasty on twitter [@fobabs](https://twitter.com/fobabs)

* I write ✍️ on my [Blog](https://blog.fobabs.com)
